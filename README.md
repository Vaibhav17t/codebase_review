## 🚀 Overview

**Code Debt Detective Prototype** is an intelligent AI-powered tool that analyzes codebases to identify and predict technical debt. This prototype leverages advanced algorithms to provide comprehensive code quality assessments, helping developers maintain cleaner, more maintainable codebases.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Comprehensive Code Analysis**: Deep scanning of codebases with configurable depth levels
- **📊 Technical Debt Detection**: Identifies various types of technical debt including:
  - Deep nesting issues
  - Long lines and readability problems
  - Technical debt comments (TODO, FIXME markers)
  - Function complexity issues
- **📈 Health Scoring**: Provides an overall health score (0-100) for your codebase
- **📋 Multiple Report Formats**: 
  - Detailed HTML reports
  - Console output
  - JSON data export
- **⚡ Quick Health Checks**: Fast overview of codebase health
- **🛠️ Configurable Analysis**: Customizable file extensions, exclusion patterns, and analysis depth
- **🐳 Docker Support**: Easy deployment and consistent environment setup

## 🎯 Analysis Categories

### 1. Deep Nesting Detection
- Identifies code blocks with excessive nesting levels
- Suggests refactoring opportunities for better readability

### 2. Line Length Analysis
- Detects overly long lines that impact readability
- Configurable character limits with smart suggestions

### 3. Technical Debt Comments
- Scans for TODO, FIXME, and other technical debt markers
- Provides confidence ratings for identified issues

### 4. Function Complexity
- Analyzes functions with too many parameters
- Suggests using configuration objects or dataclasses
